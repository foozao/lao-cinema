# Planning Documentation

This folder contains documentation for features that are **planned but not yet implemented**.

These documents describe the design and implementation approach for future features. They serve as:
- **Design specs** for upcoming work
- **Reference material** for implementation
- **Decision records** for why certain approaches were chosen

## Planned Features

### UX Improvements
- **[LOADING_INDICATORS.md](./LOADING_INDICATORS.md)** - Loading states for navigation and data fetching (hybrid approach with progress bar + delayed spinners)

## Moving Features Out

When a feature is implemented:
1. Move the documentation to `docs/features/`
2. Update the status at the top to **"Status: Implemented ✅"**
3. Add implementation date
4. Update this README to remove the entry
