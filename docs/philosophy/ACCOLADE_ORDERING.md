Do NOT introduce global prestige weightings.
Yes — keep awards before selections, even if the festival is smaller.

Then, if you want to acknowledge scale, do it visually or contextually, not through reordering.

⸻

Why weightings are a trap (especially for your platform)

1. Prestige is subjective and political

Today:
	•	Shanghai IFF = “bigger” than A-List Star Awards

Tomorrow:
	•	A regional award matters more locally
	•	A program jury award matters more artistically
	•	A festival rebrands, splits, or disappears

The moment you encode “importance,” you become an arbiter of cultural value.

That’s not where you want to be.

⸻

2. Awards vs selections is an objective distinction

This rule is defensible:

A prize won > a film selected

It doesn’t care about:
	•	Festival size
	•	Geography
	•	Reputation

That makes it stable and explainable.

⸻

3. IMDb quietly proves this point

Look at how IMDb behaves:
	•	Oscar wins
	•	Small regional awards
	•	Festival jury prizes

All are listed chronologically by type, not prestige.

They let users infer importance.

That’s a deliberate choice.

⸻

What happens if you add weightings (real risks)

If you weight events:
	•	You’ll need to explain why
	•	Filmmakers will ask why their award is lower
	•	You’ll need to maintain the scale forever
	•	Edge cases will explode (sections, labs, markets, etc.)

This becomes:
	•	Editorial policy
	•	Cultural gatekeeping
	•	Ongoing maintenance debt

⸻

The correct compromise (this fits your concern)

Instead of reordering, signal prestige without changing order.

1. Keep this order (correct):
	•	🏆 Winner (any festival)
	•	🎬 Selection (any festival)

2. Add subtle context cues (optional, safe)

Examples:
	•	Festival tier badge (A-list / International / Regional)
	•	Location prominence (country/city already helps)
	•	Tooltip: “Major international festival”

This informs without adjudicating.

⸻

Why your current layout actually works

Looking at your screenshot:
	•	The Winner line visually dominates (correct)
	•	Shanghai’s block is larger, richer, more detailed
	•	The section (“Asian Cinema New Talent”) is explicit

A knowledgeable user already feels Shanghai’s weight — without you forcing it.

⸻

The philosophical rule to lock in

Sort by achievement, not by institution.

Achievement = winner vs selection
Institution = festival prestige

You should only encode the former.

⸻

Final recommendation (clear)
	•	❌ Do not add event weightings
	•	✅ Keep awards above selections
	•	✅ Let festival names, years, and sections speak for themselves
	•	✅ Add optional contextual badges if you must

If you ever do want curation:
	•	Do it in editorial collections
	•	Not in canonical accolade ordering

⸻

One-line answer you can commit to:

We don’t rank festivals. We record achievements.

That principle will save you years of second-guessing later.
